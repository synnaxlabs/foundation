- **KIND TABLE** `kind::Kind` is typed: an associated `Config` and `impl Future`
  methods. `kind::Table` erases it inside `connector` with a private trait that takes
  the `Document` and parses again, so callers see one concrete type with no `Any` and
  no downcast. An unknown kind is the diagnostic `connector.unknown-kind`, since the
  name comes from a file. A run or a discovery fails with one of three classes:
  `Config` (stop until the spec changes), `Device`, and `Retry` (restart with
  backoff). Decided by the `connector` builder in the plan on #338, after
  `/eb-review`; approved by the coordinator (#338). `Table::check` takes where the file
  names the kind and puts `connector.unknown-kind` there; `discover` and `run` take
  their kind from the spec, which has no spans (`laptop.architect-2`,

  with no span, since a `Document` has none to place a missing attribute
  (`laptop.architect-2`,
