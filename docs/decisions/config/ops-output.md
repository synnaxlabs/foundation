- **OPS OUTPUT (#337, 2026-10-08)** The plan output is a typed `plan::Output { base,
  changes, homes, added, changed, removed }`, with `Change { action, kind, name, place:
  Option<Place> }`. It derives `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, and `JsonSchema`, and `ops`
  resolves each span to a file, line, and column. `text()` gives the terminal text, as
  `Response` and `Error` do. #1744 makes it a `Response` variant. Each error of `ops`,
  in the CLI and in MCP, has one JSON shape: `{"errors": [...]}`, each item a typed
  `Problem { code, message, fix, place: Option<Place>, notes }`. An error that is not a
  diagnostic, such as `ops.argument`, is a list of one item with no place. A place is
  `{"file", "line", "column"}`, each count from 1, and the key is absent when there is
  no place. `notes` is a list, empty when there is no note. The text of an error is each
  item as `error[<code>]: <message>`, its place, `fix: <fix>`, and each note, with an
  empty line between two items. Lost: a second shape for diagnostics, with which a
  client parses two shapes and must know which operation gives which. Decided by

  `plan` refuses a path that is not UTF-8 with `ops.path-not-utf8`, before its
  extension, so `Place::file` is the exact path. `ops.path-not-utf8` has no span,
  since a place cannot hold the path, and writes it with `{path:?}` until #941.
  `ops.unknown-extension` gets a place and names no path in its message (FRONT ENDS),
  so its path is exact too (`laptop.architect-2`, 2026-10-08T18:11:55Z,

  Lost: the lossy text, with which two files give one place; the `Debug` form in
  `Place::file`, which each JSON reader must decode; and the escaped path in the
  message of `ops.unknown-extension`, which an agent must decode. The `Place::file` doc
  names the code, not the function that refuses the path (`laptop.architect-2`,
