- **STREAM DISPATCH (2026-10-04)** `transport` is blind to protocols. The first
  message of each stream, and each datagram, starts with a header from `wire` that
  names the protocol (`clock`, `mesh`, `replica`, `blob`, `hub`). `node` holds the
  table from protocol to handler and runs one accept loop per session. A protocol
  that the table does not know comes from a peer, so the loop resets that stream with
  a code and goes on. Decided by the coordinator (network's review of #53).
