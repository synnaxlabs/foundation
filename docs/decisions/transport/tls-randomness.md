- **TLS RANDOMNESS (2026-10-04)** All randomness inside TLS (key shares, client
  random, nonces) comes from aws-lc, not from `env`. rustls holds its random source
  as a `&'static` value, and aws-lc makes X25519 key shares with its own randomness,
  so neither can be injected without a leak per `Transport`. It changes bytes, never
  sizes or timing. Simulated runs still replay because nothing branches on those
  bytes; replay traces leave out ciphertext and handshake randoms, and a `sim` test
  runs one value twice and compares the traces. The person accepted it ("Accept TLS
  RANDOMNESS"), from `network`'s proposal on #54.
