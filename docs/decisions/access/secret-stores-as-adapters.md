- **SECRET STORES AS ADAPTERS** `ctx.secret(name)` is the only path for kinds. Adapters:
  the built-in sealed store (default, works offline), a node environment variable or
  file, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager, and
  Kubernetes Secrets. A policy picks the store per name. External adapters authenticate
  with the node key and may cache values sealed to it (this delays revocation).
